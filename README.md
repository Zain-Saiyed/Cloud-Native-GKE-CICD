# Cloud-Native CI/CD Pipeline and Deploying Workload to Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE):

This repository contains the implementation of a robust Cloud-Native Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline designed for deploying workloads on Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE). Leveraging Docker, GCP tools, and Terraform for Infrastructure as Code (IaC), this project streamlines the deployment process, ensuring efficient and scalable applications on the GKE cluster. From data persistence management to containerized environment diagnostics, the pipeline is engineered to enhance development workflows in cloud-native environments.

## Key Features:

- Cloud-native CI/CD pipeline integration with Docker, GCP tools, and Terraform.
- Efficient data persistence implementation within the GKE cluster.
- Utilization of Kubernetes tools, including kubectl, for container interaction and issue diagnosis.
- Demonstration of application update strategies in GKE for effective version control.
